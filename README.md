# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict
the likelihood of a breast cancer. A few machine learning techniques have been explored.
In this project, Support Vector Machine is being implemented with 99% accuracy.
